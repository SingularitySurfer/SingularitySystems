# The role of central bank capital revisited - ECB - Monte Carlo Simulations

https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/152826/1/ecbwp0392.pdf

This paper by Bindseil, Manzanares, and Weller (2004) is from the ECB working paper series which runs a series of Monte Carlo analyses to study the role of central bank capital (amongst other interesting analysis). They focus on the relationship between the Central Bank's balance sheet structure and inflation performance. They conclude that "Capital thus remains a key tool to ensure that central banks are unconstrained in their focus on price stability in monetary policy decisions."

One of the key arguments which comes out of this paper is that a central banks net worth is important.

They start by describing a simple balance-sheet based model of a central bank, asusming no liquidity constraints. We describe the model below:

1. Assets:
    * Monetary policy operations $M$
        * Interpret as residual of the balance sheet, and thus will earn a rate of $i_M %$.
        * CB is assumed to follow a simplified Taylor rule $i_{M,t} = 4 + 1.5(\pi_{t-1} - 2)$. A floor of zero is assumed.
    * Other financial assets $F$
        * This includes foreign exchange reserves (gold) and potentially domestic financial assets.
        * Assume remunerated at $ i_F % $
        * Assume that $i_{F,t} = i_{M,t} + \rho + \omega_t$ where $\omega_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \,\sigma_{\omega}^{2}) $ and $\rho$ is some level of asset revaluation gains/losses
2. Liabilities:
    * Banknotes $B$
        * Function of finlation, and will tend to increase over time
        * $ B_t = B_{t-1} + B_{t-1}\frac{(2+\pi_t)}{100} + \epsilon_t $ where $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate, $2$ is the assumed real interest rate and $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \,\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}) $.
        * Real interest rate is assumed to be exogenous (outside of model)
    * Capital $C$
        * Capital is a function of previous years capital and previous year's profit & loss (P&L)
        * Assumed that if previous years profit, $P_{t_1} > 0 $ then there'll be an $\alpha$ proportion of profit sharing and thus: $C_t = C_{t-1} + \alpha P_{t-1} $ else the full loss is born so $C_t = C_{t-1} + P_{t-1} $

To model inflation, a Wicksellian relationship is assumed:
