<p>SingularitySystems is a blog about how to make information change form and how to control the various media it resides in.

<p>While we could just call it signal processing, control theory and computer science, I think the purely technical view does not capture an important part of engineering: It is done by humans.

<p>So while digging deep into the guts of the machines we build, we will also marvel at the beauty of the concepts, structures and patterns that emerge in the process.
