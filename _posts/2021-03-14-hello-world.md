Have you ever seen information? What is it anyways?

<!-- What is it anyways? What can we do with it? -->
<!-- Questions asked by the utterly deranged!! -->

One might say that's a stupid question to ask. Usually we care about what that information means and not what it fundamentally is.
However, deep inside the guts of some server farm the information representing this blog exists as the tiny amount of electrical charge on a floating gate transistor. This information goes on the most incredible and miraculous journey until it finally leaves the liquid crystals in your display. With the complexity and scale already unfathomable for an individual, even deeper information flows are being developed by an ever growing number of scientists and engineers.

<!-- However, if you start to dig a bit into how our current and future machines make this information flow, you will come across some of the weirdest and most wonderful stuff you can find in this world. -->
<!-- Ofc there are other interesting things like life that also processes information in crazy ways! -->

So that's what this blog is about. Exploring the ways humans are orchestrating the universe to conduct and process information.

The content will range from deep dives into signal processing on digital hardware (gateware), random projects involving FPGAs/lasers/computers, overviews over a particular system/medium to philosophical takes on fundamental concepts. A focus will be on open source, open science and collaborative engineering because sustainable progress cannot happen inside the ivory towers built by some of today's organizations.

All that stuff is gonna be somewhat unfiltered and narrated from a subjective viewpoint. I am a human myself, I am not an expert in anything, I am biased, I often make mistakes. (Un)fortunately this is the world wild web, not a peer-reviewed journal[^1]. That being said, I will give my best to not spread false (technical) facts and I always appreciate constructive feedback!

So if you too want to learn about how to use the scientific and technical toolkit inherited from generations of brilliant minds, hop in on the ride! It's gonna be fun for sure!

P.S. Sorry for the cheesy title, I promise I'll use the magic q-word sparsely ;)

Well, here is some: A cheesy blog post titled "Hello World(s)".

Wow, what a creative way to start a blog! Not really, but it's just too good of a line to not not use it.
Because


- CATCHEN!!!
- was kommt?
- welche art?
- open source stuff
- hype
- not for physicists and software engineers
- sometimes hardcore ecplicit engineering (signal processing) content
- sometimes rants about awesome topics

- DISCLAIMER I am human and wrong most of the time (just like much of the published research)
- this is the internet. no peer review process!
- i try to be responsible and not too misleading -->
